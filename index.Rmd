I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig, Germany). 
My research mainly focuses on reconstructing human past through the lens of fauna using biomolecular techniques.
Specialize in stable isotopes, vibrational spectrocopy, zooarchaeology through mass spectrometry (ZooMS), and paleoproteomics.
*I also dabble in R programming.*
